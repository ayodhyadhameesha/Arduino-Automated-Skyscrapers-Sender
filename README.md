# Automated-Skyscrapers-Sender
This is small project implemented using arduino to send sky scrapers safely using bluetooth technology.
The process of this project is sending the Skyscarper automatically.The skyscraper end is connected to a metal wire.metal wire is connected to wires and wires are connected to the relay.
Arduino Uno,8 channel relay module,bluetooth sensor,12v 2A transformer is used as hardware in this project.
Arduino IDE is used as the hardware.
The process is as follows

*Install bluetooth arduino app
*Pair the bluetooth module and smartphone
*Customize the app as you want.
*Press the button you want to send
*After pressing the button the respective relay will be activated and it will burn the metal wire and skyscraper end will burn and fire.
